Here discuss about some question based on my this project and try to answer it properly


## FAQ

#### Question 1 : What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

- Answer : -1. "getElementById" gets one element by ID. 2. "getElementsByClassName" gets a live collection by class. 3. "querySelector/querySelectorAll" use CSS selectors for single elements or static lists, offering more flexibility.

#### Question 2 : How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

- Answer : Create an element with document."createElement()". Configure it with properties like "textConten"t or "className". Finally, insert it using a method like "appendChild()" on a parent node to add it to the DOM.

#### Question 3 : What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?

- Answer : Event bubbling is the process where an event starts from the target element and propagates upward through all its ancestor elements in the DOM tree.

#### Question 4 : What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

- Answer : Event Delegation uses a single parent listener to handle events from multiple children, improving performance and supporting dynamic elements.

#### Question 5 : What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?

- Answer : 1."preventDefault()" stops the browser's default action for an event (like following a link). 2."stopPropagation()" stops the event from bubbling up the DOM tree to parent elements. They control different aspects of event handling.
